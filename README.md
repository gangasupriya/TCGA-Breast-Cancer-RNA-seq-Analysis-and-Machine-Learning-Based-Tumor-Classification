# TCGA Breast Cancer RNA-seq Analysis & Machine Learning-Based Tumor Classification


##  Overview
This project performs a differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data to identify potential biomarkers. The analysis uses statistical methods to detect significantly upregulated and downregulated genes across different biological conditions. The goal is to highlight genes that may be involved in disease mechanisms or treatment responses.

##  Objectives
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using statistical models.
- Visualize expression trends and significance using interactive tools.
- Interpret biological relevance through biomarker discovery potential.

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language**: R  
- Libraries**: DESeq2, ggplot2  
- Visualization**: Tableau (for Volcano plots and significance patterns)  
- Data Format**: RNA-Seq count matrix  

##  Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing  
   - Imported raw count data  
   - Set up experimental design (control vs treatment)  

2. Differential Expression Analysis  
   - Applied DESeq2 to compute `log2FoldChange` and adjusted p-values (`padj`)  
   - Filtered genes based on significance thresholds (`padj < 0.05`)  

3. Visualization  
   - Created volcano plots in Tableau  
   - Highlighted significantly upregulated and downregulated genes  

4. Result Interpretation 
   - Identified gene signatures with potential functional/clinical relevance  


##  Key Outcomes
- Identified top differentially expressed genes
- Built clean visual summaries (volcano plots)
- Established a reusable pipeline for DEG analysis
